# ElevatorControlWithFuzzyLogic
Elevator group control system using fuzzy logic triangular membership function

In this project i've made a elevator group control system using fuzzy logic. Elevator groups are normally used in commercial buildings and their control can be carried out in different ways, for instance by using the nearest elevator for attending the hall calls or by using a selection process, which evaluates multiple criteria 
in order to compute the most suitable elevator.From this point of view, the main objective of this work is the analysis and application of fuzzy control techniques in order to define the attribution of elevator priorities for attending the hall calls. . This work considers a Destination Control System and load capasity, which provides the control system with an a-priori knowledge of the desired floor for each hall call.

First ol all create the variables. Three of them are input variable and priority is output for fuzzy logic:

After that create membership functions:
